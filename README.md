# Monty Hall Simulation
The Monty Hall Simulation plans to run a simulation of the well known Monty Hall problem. The program will take the number of simulations from the user and run that number of times. The user has the choice of always switching, or always staying with their original choice. The program will total the number of wins and plot both wins and loses on a pie chart.
